[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxxx.svg)](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxxx)

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the figures and analyses for the paper "The Human Phenotype Project: Deep phenotyping of the health-disease continuum"".

## Features
- **README.md**: This file.

- **Figure1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code to generate Figure 1 of the HPP resource paper. This includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps specific to Figure 1.

- **Figure2.ipynb**: Notebook for Figure 2, detailing the methods and code used to produce the analyses and visualizations presented in the second figure of the paper.

- **Figure3.ipynb**: Contains the code and analysis workflow for generating Figure 3, including any statistical analyses and plots.

- **Figure4.ipynb**: This notebook includes the code for Figure 4, covering the data analysis and visualization steps.

- **Figure 4 (d,f,g).ipynb**: Focuses on specific panels (d, f, g) of Figure 4, providing detailed code and explanations for these sub-figures.

- **Figure5.ipynb**: Contains the analysis and plotting code for Figure 5, illustrating the relevant findings as presented in the paper.

- **Figure6.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to Figure 6, detailing the computational steps and visualizations used.

- **utils.py**: A Python script containing utility functions that are used across multiple notebooks for data processing and analysis tasks.

Details on the analyses are described in the "Methods" of the paper. 
Data to reproduce this code is available in https://humanphenotypeproject.org/
